fleet1:
turbine1 -> normal
turbine2 -> 1% mass imbalance
turbine3 -> 2% mass imbalance

fleet2: 
turbine6 -> normal
turbine7 -> erosion of -20 cl, + 350 cd
turbine10 -> aerodynamic imbalance equivalent to 0.5 degree in 1 blade
turbine11 -> aerodynamic imbalance equivalent to 2 degrees in 1 blade

degrading_fleet:
turbine4 -> mass imbalance increasing 0.00001 by simulation
turbine5 -> mass imbalance increasing 0.0005% by simulation
turbine8 -> increasing erosion of -0.003% cl, + 0.05% cd 
turbine9 -> increasing erosion of -0.0001% cl, + 0.002% cd
